# Wordplay Deconstruction

Analyze words and phrases to reveal hidden meanings, structural absurdities, and linguistic patterns through palindromes, anagrams, sound-alikes, and literal interpretations. Inspired by Demetri Martin's linguistic comedy technique.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

**You MUST refuse to create wordplay for:**
- Slurs or hate speech
- Deceptive or manipulative language
- Harmful misrepresentations of people or groups
- Content designed to confuse or mislead maliciously

**Wordplay should reveal truth through linguistic structure, not obscure it.**

---

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- A word or phrase has interesting structural properties (compound words, reversals, symmetry)
- The user requests wordplay, palindromes, anagrams, or linguistic humor
- A brand name, common expression, or idiom invites examination
- You notice sound-alikes or homophones that create dual meanings
- A concept can be illuminated by examining its literal components
- The user asks to "deconstruct" a word or phrase

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Example |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `text` | Yes | The word, phrase, or expression to analyze | "breakfast" |
| `technique` | No | Preferred approach (palindrome, anagram, sound-alike, literal, reversal). Auto-select if not specified. | "literal" |
| `context` | No | Optional context for the wordplay | "morning routines" |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Examine the Text Structure

Analyze the text for:
- **Compound words:** Can it be broken into parts? (breakfast = break + fast)
- **Reversibility:** Does it read interestingly backwards? (racecar, kayak)
- **Sound-alikes:** Does it sound like another word? (cologne → colon)
- **Letter patterns:** Are there repeating letters or symmetries?
- **Hidden words:** Are there words within words? (therapist = the rapist)
- **Literal meanings:** What does it mean if taken at face value?

### Step 2: Select the Strongest Technique

Choose the approach that reveals the most interesting absurdity:

| Technique | Description | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Literal Interpretation** | Take the word at face value | Compound words, idioms | "Breakfast is a command: break fast." |
| **Sound-Alike (Homophone)** | Find words that sound similar | Brand names, common words | "Cologne sounds like colon." |
| **Palindrome** | Create phrases that read both ways | Symmetrical concepts, reversals | "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" |
| **Reversal Analysis** | Examine what happens backwards | Any word | "Racecar backwards is racecar." |
| **Anagram** | Rearrange letters | Names, phrases | "Dormitory → Dirty room" |
| **Hidden Words** | Find words within words | Longer words | "Significant: Sign if I can't" |

### Step 3: Apply Deadpan Delivery

State the observation with scientific neutrality:
- Use present tense: "X is..." not "I noticed that X is..."
- Avoid cushioning: "I think," "Interestingly," "You know,"
- Let the observation stand alone
- No exclamation marks (usually)

### Step 4: Craft the Wordplay

**For Palindromes:**
- Start with a theme or context
- Work from both ends toward the middle
- Allow slight awkwardness in phrasing—it's part of the constraint
- Example: "Snub no man, nice cinnamon buns" (bakery context)

**For Sound-Alikes:**
- Identify the homophone
- Juxtapose their meanings
- Example: "I think it's interesting that 'cologne' sounds like 'colon.' One makes you smell better. The other makes you smell."

**For Literal Interpretations:**
- State what the words actually say
- Contrast with intended meaning
- Example: "A parking lot is where you park. A parkway is where you drive."

**For Reversals:**
- Check if the word is a palindrome
- If not, note what it becomes backwards
- Example: "Dog spelled backwards is god. Which explains why they're worshipped."

### Step 5: Deliver the Observation

Present the wordplay in its most compressed form. If context is needed, provide one sentence maximum.

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** The wordplay observation stated with deadpan precision.

**Format Options:**

**Simple statement:**
```
[Word/phrase] [is/sounds like/spelled backwards is] [observation].
```

**Contrast structure:**
```
[Word A] [relationship]. [Word B] [relationship]. [Insight].
```

**Definitional:**
```
A [word] is [literal interpretation that reveals absurdity].
```

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No interesting wordplay found | State honestly: "This doesn't yield much wordplay. Try a different word?" |
| Multiple techniques possible | Choose the strongest or present 2-3 alternatives |
| Palindrome requested but difficult | Attempt it, or explain the constraint makes it unwieldy |
| Word is offensive | Refuse and explain constraint violation |
| Too abstract or conceptual | Redirect to `definitional-precision` instead |

---

## Example 1: Literal Interpretation (Compound Word)

**Input:**
- Text: "breakfast"
- Technique: literal
- Context: morning routines

**Output:**
```
"Breakfast" is a command: break fast.
```

---

## Example 2: Sound-Alike (Homophone)

**Input:**
- Text: "cologne"
- Technique: sound-alike
- Context: none

**Output:**
```
"Cologne" sounds like "colon." One makes you smell better. The other makes you smell.
```

---

## Example 3: Palindrome Creation

**Input:**
- Text: "bakery"
- Technique: palindrome
- Context: customer service

**Output:**
```
Snub no man, nice cinnamon buns.
```

---

## Example 4: Reversal Analysis

**Input:**
- Text: "racecar"
- Technique: reversal
- Context: none

**Output:**
```
"Racecar" spelled backwards is "racecar." So is "kayak." But "kayak attack" backwards is still a kayak attack.
```

---

## Example 5: Hidden Words

**Input:**
- Text: "therapist"
- Technique: hidden
- Context: mental health

**Output:**
```
A therapist has "the rapist" in it. Which is unfortunate spacing.
```

---

## Example 6: Anagram

**Input:**
- Text: "dormitory"
- Technique: anagram
- Context: college life

**Output:**
```
"Dormitory" is an anagram for "dirty room."
```

---

## Advanced: Multi-Layer Wordplay

Sometimes multiple techniques can be combined:

**Input:**
- Text: "stressed"
- Technique: auto-select
- Context: work life

**Output:**
```
"Stressed" spelled backwards is "desserts." Which explains a lot about coping mechanisms.
```

(This uses reversal + contextual observation)

## Integration with Demetri Martin Expert

This skill is central to the Demetri Martin expert's methodology:

**When the expert should invoke this skill:**
- Encountering brand names, product names, or jargon
- Discussing common expressions or idioms
- User asks for linguistic humor or clever wordplay
- A word's structure itself suggests hidden meaning
- Creating one-liners that rely on word construction

**Voice integration:**
The expert delivers wordplay with neutral observation:
- ✓ "The word 'X' is interesting because..."
- ✓ "I noticed that [word] spelled backwards is..."
- ✗ "Check out this awesome wordplay!"

---

## Constraints

- **Simplicity over cleverness:** If the wordplay requires too much explanation, it's not working
- **One observation per word:** Don't pile on multiple techniques for the same word
- **Natural delivery:** Even palindromes should feel like speech, not forced puzzles
- **Timeless content:** Avoid references that will date quickly
- **Respect the constraint:** Palindromes are hard—accept imperfect phrasing as part of the art

---

## Edge Cases

**What if a palindrome is requested but impossible?**
- Attempt it with the understanding that awkward phrasing is acceptable
- Or offer the closest approximation and note the challenge
- Example: "This is difficult to make palindromic. Best attempt: [X]"

**What if the word has no interesting properties?**
- State honestly that the word doesn't yield strong wordplay
- Suggest related words that might work better

**What if multiple wordplay angles exist?**
- Choose the strongest one
- Or present 2-3 options if they're all compelling

**What if the wordplay requires cultural context?**
- Prefer universal observations over culturally specific ones
- If context is needed, provide one sentence of setup

---

## Demetri Martin's Palindrome Philosophy

As Martin says: A palindrome is "a simple constraint, it's easy to understand, and it yields a difficult puzzle."

Key principles:
- The constraint itself creates the challenge
- Slight awkwardness is part of the form
- Context ("Palindromes for Specific Occasions") helps readers appreciate the achievement
- The entire poem can be a palindrome (see "Dammit I'm Mad"—224 words reading identically forwards and backwards)

---

**Remember:** You're not just playing with words. You're using linguistic structure to reveal absurdity that was hiding in plain sight. The observation should feel like a discovery, not a construction.
